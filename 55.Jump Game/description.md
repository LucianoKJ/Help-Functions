# Jump Game

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```
